Challenge: Front-End exercise
=============================

*** Hello and welcome to our challenge! ***

Goal: We want to build a web interface for our meat food specialized shop and we need your help. 

Inputs:
1) We provide you the designs of the web for different devices.

Requirements:
1) Web must be responsive.
2) Take any picture you prefer from an online SaaS service like flickr, use their REST API (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
3) Add a map (google maps) to display our shops in your city. Use their REST API.
4) Add a section displaying tweets related to "meat is healthy" from your nearby. Use their REST API.
5) Interface must support multilanguage.

Assumptions:
* Assume any search criteria that allows you displaying shops in the map (e.g. nearby shops where they sell meat).
* Map can be placed according to your criteria.
* Tweets can be displayed according to your criteria.
* Provide multilanguage support (at least 2 languages). 
* There is no need to translate whole interface, just a title and a description is enough.
* Justify the language switching strategy you choose (place a language switcher, use headers, default configs, etc.).

Delivery:
1) Share with us a github repository with your code.
2) Provide clear instructions so we can test and run your code.
3) Provide necessary minimal documenatation you think would be useful.

Notes: 
* Use of ReactJS is a plus.
* You are fully free to choose any public repository to simplify implementation/functionalities.
* Focus on writing the best code you can produce. 
* Tell us how much time did you invest in the exercise. 
* Any justified suggestion, comment, modification is welcome.
* This exercise is voluntary and will not be compensated.
* Intellectual Property belongs to the candidate and will not be used by OS. It's only for evaluation purposes.
