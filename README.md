#MEAT shop project

I assumed that this task did not require pixel perfect conversion

###Twitter api notes
For some reason there are not many tweets around my location with a keyword "meat is healthy".
API accepts Geo location parameters, but it is commented out in the `tweet.js` module to return greater amount of tweets
 
Click on the `text` of a twitter message will lead to the original tweet



The app was developed with Node.js of version 7, latest LTS (6.x) will also work well
 
To run this project you need to do `npm install` and `npm run`. It will run a server at `http://localhost:8080`
